wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage
-----------------------------

wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage are command line tools to render HTML into PDF
and various image formats using the QT Webkit rendering engine. These run
entirely "headless" and do not require a display or display service.

See http://wkhtmltopdf.org for updated documentation.
